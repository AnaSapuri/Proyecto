				Our mission is to help you sell and ship stuff directly to your fans for a fraction of the cost and effort of doing it yourself. Blackbox works like a co-op: if we all go in together, we get the cheapest pricing, the fastest shipping, and the best service. The shipping is fast. We pay your sales tax. You can customize the packaging and the inserts. It’s pretty great.
			</p>
			<p>
				We think the future will favor independent creators selling their own products, without publishers or bloodsucking middlemen taking most of the money. In fact, we’re betting the company on it.

			<h3>Case Study</h3>
			<h2>OK Cookie</h2>
			<p>
				Blackbox is the company we wish existed when we started Cards Against Humanity. To show off what Blackbox can do for a small business, we started The OK Cookie Company.

				The OK Cookie Company sells fortune cookies with funny messages like: “Today, you will meet the love of your life. Or maybe not. I’m just a cookie.” This product was too stupid for us to sell and ship ourselves, but we used Blackbox’s tools to get it up and running in just a few days.
